Synopsis
--------

nekStab (Stability for Nek5000) is an open-source toolbox for massively-parallel eigenproblem and base flow computation developed for the Nek500 solver.
It aims at solving any fluid flow of an incompressible, Newtonian fluid that can benefit from a Krylov-Schuer eigensolver.
It supports natively 2D and 3D meshes with all sorts of boundary conditions and optional scalar transport equations.
It aims to help users and developers ...
